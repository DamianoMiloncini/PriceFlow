# PriceWave repository 
Ecommerce semester 4 final project

**First Push**
- Began html layout and css to chose a website design we will go for

**Second Push**
- Began the implementation of the map API using Leaflet

# Deliverable 1 - **Completed**
Deliverable 1 requires us to complete an entire suite of feature tests using CodeCeption to write and execute these tests using Gherkin.

Additionally, a completed ERD is required to present the full structure of the database.

## Feature Suite
- **Status:** Feature suite has been completed!

## ERD 
- **Status:** ERD has been completed!

## User authentication
- **Status:** User basic authentication(register,login,log out, update profile, view profile, setup2fa, check2fa) is complete.
Left to do: Update user 2fa & save + update user's location

## Map 
- **Status:** Complete! (Hardcoded for now until web scraping is complete) 
- Map API appears to be functioning perfectly!
- I had to use a second API in order to properly map every store to its exact location (converting address string to coordinates) which works well aswell.

## 50% Features (Micka)
- Updating 2FA is done
- Save location to a user account is done
- Update save location partially done(i have to fix a little bug)
- Display Bookmark items is done 

# Search Engine 
(Damiano)
- Began working on the full functionalities and styling of the search engine.
- So far, the filtering works perfectly as I am able to switch between item and recipe search freely.
- The sorting works as well!
There are some bugs to be fixed of course, but these will be addressed shortly. 

# Search by Location
- Search by location works well with the google API ! I need to wait for the webscraping and the filters to merge everything together.
- Search details is almost figured out ! :)
